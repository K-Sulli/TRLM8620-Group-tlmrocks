# TRLM8620-Final
This web application is developed and localized by Ruiqi Ma, Ismenia Miranda, Julie Montedoro, Xiaofei Shen and Kayli Sullivan. Thank you all for your efforts and hard work.
This project is initiated by our client Pedego Ebikes for the development and localization of their online shopping portal. We based our project off of a sample Github web application repository and localized the website from English into French. We performed tasks such as localizability check, code internationalization and text translation.
